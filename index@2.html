        <h3>TO WORK CONSISTENTLY</h3> <!-- this is heading-->

        <p>
            Working consistently is the key to achieving long-term success in any field. 
            It builds discipline, improves skills, and ensures steady progress toward goals.
            When you work consistently, you develop good habits that make tasks easier over time, 
            reducing procrastination and last-minute stress. Even small efforts, when done regularly, 
            lead to significant results. 
            Consistency also helps in maintaining motivation and overcoming challenges, 
            as it creates a routine that keeps you focused and productive.
